## Getting Started with Pinata

Whether you're brand new to IPFS or a seasoned developer, Pinata makes it simple to store and retrieve content with speed and security. All you need to kick your journey is a [free Pinata account](https://app.pinata.cloud/register)!

### 1. Get API key and Gateway URL

/>

Inside the [Pinata App](https://app.pinata.cloud) select "API Keys" from the sidebar, then click "New Key" in the top right. We would recommend starting with Admin privileges and unlimited uses to start. You will receive a `pinata_api_key`, `pinata_api_secret`, and a `JWT`. The JWT is the most common authentication method and what we'll be using below.

Next you will want to grab your Dedicated Gateway domain by clicking the Gateways tab in the sidebar. You should see it listed in the format `fun-llama-300.mypinata.cloud` and you will want to copy it exactly like that.

### 2. Upload a File

Copy this code into your Typescript or JavaScript program and make sure to supplement your API JWT key

```tsx
const JWT = "PINATA_JWT";

async function pinFileToIPFS() {
  try {
    const text = "Hello World!";
    const blob = new Blob([text], { type: "text/plain" });
    const file = new File([blob], "hello-world.txt");
    const data = new FormData();
    data.append("file", file);

    const request = await fetch(
      "https://api.pinata.cloud/pinning/pinFileToIPFS",
      {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
        },
        body: data,
      }
    );
    const response = await request.json();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

await pinFileToIPFS();
```

You should get a response object like the one below

```typescript
{
  IpfsHash: "Qmf1rtki74jvYmGeqaaV51hzeiaa6DyWc98fzDiuPatzyy",
  PinSize: 20,
  Timestamp: "2024-02-03T18:42:14.989Z"
}
```

The `IpfsHash` is more commonly recognized as the `CID`, both a hash verifying the content’s authenticity but also it serves as the address to the file.

### 3. Retrieve a File from IPFS

Now that your file is on IPFS it can be fetched through your Gateway

```typescript
const JWT = "PINATA_JWT";
const GATEWAY = "my-example.mypinata.cloud";
const CID = "Qmf1rtki74jvYmGeqaaV51hzeiaa6DyWc98fzDiuPatzyy";

async function fetchFileFromIPFS() {
  const url = `https://${GATEWAY}/ipfs/${CID}`;
  try {
    const request = await fetch(url);
    const response = await request.text();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

await fetchFileFromIPFS();
// Hello World!
```
