For all operations that result in a file being uploaded or added to an account, there are optional pieces of data that can be included. 

## `pinataMetadata`

<Info>This is not to be confused with NFT metadata, as this metadata about files uploaded to Pinata is not on IPFS but a private database with Pinata</Info>

In addition to pinning your file to Pinata, you also have the option to include metadata for Pinata to store internally for your to use later.

This metadata can later be used for easy querying on what you've pinned with our [pinList]() request.

The optional metadata object takes the following form:

```json
{
    name: "A custom name. If you don't provide this value, it will automatically be populated by the original name of the file you've uploaded",
    keyvalues: {
        customKey: "customValue",
        customKey2: "customValue2"
    }
}
```

## `pinataOptions`

Pinata supports adding additional options when pinning a file. The following options are currently supported for this endpoint:

- cidVersion - The CID Version IPFS will use when creating a hash for your content. Valid options are: "0" (CIDv0) or "1" (CIDv1)
- wrapWithDirectory - Wrap your content inside of a directory when adding to IPFS. This allows users to retrieve content via a filename instead of just a hash. For a more detailed explanation, see [this informative blogpost](https://flyingzumwalt.gitbooks.io/decentralized-web-primer/content/files-on-ipfs/lessons/wrap-directories-around-content.html). Valid options are: true or false

Here is an example of the object to create `pinataOptions`:

```json
pinataOptions: {
    cidVersion: 0, 
    wrapWithDirectory: false
}
```
