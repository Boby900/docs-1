Groups allow you to organize your Pinata content through the Pinata App or through the Pinata API, giving your a clearer picture of what your files are being used for.

## Pinata API

With the Pinata API you can create groups, add files to groups, list details about a group, and more! For the full reference check out our Pinata API Reference for [Groups](/api-reference/endpoint/create-group).

### Create a Group

To create a group you can send a `POST` request to `/groups` with the following JSON body that contains the name of the group:

```json
{
  "name": "my-group"
}
```

This will return the Group info

```json
{
  "id": "61a4a882-1591-462e-bcb7-fa0eee5f3c51",
  "user_id": "ec50a085-a746-428d-b01d-167ac379fbd4",
  "name": "NFT-Project",
  "updatedAt": "2024-07-03T18:09:33.610Z",
  "createdAt": "2024-07-03T18:09:33.610Z"
}
```

### Get a Group

To fetch details of an already existing group make a `GET` request with the `id` of the group as the path paramter: `/group/:id`. This will return the Group info:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "61a4a882-1591-462e-bcb7-fa0eee5f3c51",
    "name": "NFT-Project-updated",
    "user_id": "ec50a085-a746-428d-b01d-167ac379fbd4",
    "createdAt": "2024-07-03T18:09:33.610Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-07-03T18:15:17.440Z"
  }
]
```

### List All Groups

If you want to get all Groups or filter through them you can make a `GET` request to `/group`. This endpoint accepts the following query params:

<ParamField query="nameContains" type="string" default="none">
Filter by name of the group
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="offset" type="integer" default="none">
Paginate through next series of groups
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="limit" type="integer" default="none">
Limit the number of results
</ParamField>

This will return an array of Groups and their respective info:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "61a4a882-1591-462e-bcb7-fa0eee5f3c51",
    "name": "NFT-Project-updated",
    "user_id": "ec50a085-a746-428d-b01d-167ac379fbd4",
    "createdAt": "2024-07-03T18:09:33.610Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-07-03T18:15:17.440Z"
  }
]
```

### Updating the Name of a Group

Updating the name of a group is done by sending a `PUT` request to `/groups/:id` where the Group ID is  a path param, as well as the JSON body with the new name:

```json
{
  "name": "NFT-Project-updated"
}
```

This will return the updated Group info.

```json
{
  "id": "61a4a882-1591-462e-bcb7-fa0eee5f3c51",
  "name": "NFT-Project-updated",
  "user_id": "ec50a085-a746-428d-b01d-167ac379fbd4",
  "createdAt": "2024-07-03T18:09:33.610Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-07-03T18:12:46.930Z"
}
```

### Add CIDs to a Group

<Note>At this time CIDs can only belong to one group at a time. If a CID is added to a Group while already being part of another, it will move the CID to the latest requested Group.</Note>

Once a Group is created you can then add files to that Group by sending a `PUT` request to `/groups/:id/cids` which takes the Group ID as a path parameter, as well as a JSON body with an array of CIDs:

```json
{
  "cids": [
    "QmVLwvmGehsrNEvhcCnnsw5RQNseohgEkFNN1848zNzdng",
    "bafkreih5aznjvttude6c3wbvqeebb6rlx5wkbzyppv7garjiubll2ceym4"
  ]
}
```

If successful the endpoint will return an `OK` response.


### Removing CIDs from a Group

To remove CIDs from a Group you would follow the same pattern as adding except with a `DELETE` request instead.

```json
{
  "cids": [
    "QmVLwvmGehsrNEvhcCnnsw5RQNseohgEkFNN1848zNzdng",
    "bafkreih5aznjvttude6c3wbvqeebb6rlx5wkbzyppv7garjiubll2ceym4"
  ]
}
```

If successful the endpoint will return an `OK` response.

### Delete a Group

<Note>Deleting a Group that has CIDs inside of it will not unpin/delete the CIDs. Please use [/pinning/unpin](/api-reference/endpoint/unpin-file) to actually delete a file from your account</Note>

To delete a Group you can send a `DELETE` request to `/groups/:id` which takes the Group ID as a path parameter.

If successful the endpoint will return an `OK` response.
