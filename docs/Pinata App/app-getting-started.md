The Pinata app is the core place to access Pinata services, anything from uploading files, sharing them, or setting up your Dedicated Gateway. 

## Upload Your First File

To get a sense of how Pinata works, lets walk you through a simple file upload. First, make sure you are signed in at app.pinata.cloud.

        null,
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}

Once you are logged in, you should see the Files page. To upload a file, click on the "Add Files" button in the top right. Go ahead and choose single file From there you can customize the name, and click upload.

It should open a new tab and open the file with your own [Dedicated Gateway](doc:dedicated-ipfs-gateways).
