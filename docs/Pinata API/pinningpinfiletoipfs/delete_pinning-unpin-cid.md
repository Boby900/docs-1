The process of removing files from IPFS is called unpinning. When you unpin something from an IPFS storage node, it is marked for garbage collection. When garbage collection runs, the content is permanently deleted from the storage node. 

> ðŸš§ Keep in mind that if someone else has pinned your content on IPFS then it will stay available even if you have deleted your files
