With Pinata Video Streaming and your Dedicated Gateway, you get access to streaming video. Rather than wait for a video to download entirely, people who want to view your content can stream it in the same way they stream YouTube and Netflix. ‌

All you have to do is append `?stream=true` to the end of your gateway URL for any particular video: ‌

`https://your-gateway-subdomain.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/<CID>?stream=true`

Here is an example of a video without streaming: 

<https://kyletut.com/ipfs/QmahdJBPpwwheQMvKHnJEgs1NvnsFccxfPvcRUt9uKBsnk>

And here's an example of a video with streaming: 

<https://kyletut.com/ipfs/QmahdJBPpwwheQMvKHnJEgs1NvnsFccxfPvcRUt9uKBsnk?stream=true>

This will apply to videos you have uploaded since getting access to the Video Streaming functionality. Any previously uploaded videos will need to be re-uploaded to get access to streaming. ‌ 

If you don't have a Dedicated Gateway yet, [try it out for yourself today](https://app.pinata.cloud/billing)!
