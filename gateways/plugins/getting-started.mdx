Dedicated Gateways are crucial for retrieving and delivering content on IPFS, but there are times you may need additonal functionality. Gateway Plugins serve that purpose, anything from hot swapping CIDs to delivering signatures and more!

## Installing Plugins

You can install plugins either through the Pinata App or the Pinata API.

### Pinata App

To install a plugin navigate to the Plugins Marketplace tab on the right side.
