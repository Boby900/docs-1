Make sure you are using a recent version of Node. We recommend `14.17.6` or above.

First, you have to install it.

`npm i -g pinata-upload-cli`

Once it's installed, you will be able to check all the functionality by running: 

`pinata-cli -h` 

You can upload files and folders using this CLI, and you can upload them to the public IPFS network through Pinata.

To upload to the public IPFS network, you'll need a [Pinata API Key JWT](). 

## Usage

Authenticate Public IPFS: 

```
pinata-cli -a [Pinata JWT]
```

Upload a folder or file to public IPFS: 

```
pinata-cli -u ../../../test/folder/relative/path
```
