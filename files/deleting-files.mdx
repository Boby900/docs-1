Deleting files from Pinata is simple and easy!

## Deleting Programatically

The SDK has a very simple [delete](/sdk/files/delete) method that will allow you to delete an array of files by `id`.

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const unpin = await pinata.files.delete([
  "3c52f1b8-11b1-40d9-849d-5f05a4bbd76d",
  "b72886db-9dd4-434c-a1b2-f9d36781ecee"
])
```

### Deleting All Files

If you find yourself in a position where you need to delete most or all of your files you can use the [Auto Paginate](/sdk/files/list#auto-paginate) feature on the SDK to fetch all the IDs of your files and delete them in a few lines of code!

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
	pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
	pinataGateway: "dweb.mypinata.cloud",
});

async function main() {
	try {
		let files = [];
		for await (const item of pinata.files.list()) {
			files.push(item.id);
		}
		const res = await pinata.files.delete(files);
	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error);
	}
}

main();
```

## Deleting by Web App
