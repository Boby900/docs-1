### Listing Files in a Group

To list all the files that are part of a group you can use the [list](/sdk/files/list) method and the `group` filter.

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const files = await pinata
  .listFiles()
  .group('648767d5-0a80-4b3a-9669-93693e4a0519')
```


This will return an array of [PinListItem](/ipfs-sdk/types#pinlistitem) objects.

```typescript
[
    {
        id: "2fd6175d-9220-4ea4-8939-b9cb572f08a4",
        name: "hello.txt",
        cid: "bafkreibm6jg3ux5qumhcn2b3flc3tyu6dmlb4xa7u5bf44yegnrjhc4yeq",
        size: 5,
        number_of_files: 1,
        mime_type: "text/plain",
        group_id: null,
        updated_at: "2024-08-27T19:14:36.978738Z",
        created_at: "2024-08-27T17:14:42.315122Z",
    }
]
```


### Add CIDs to a Group // TO DO

<Note>
  At this time, CIDs can only belong to one group at a time. If a CID is added
  to a Group while already being part of another, it will move the CID to the
  latest requested Group.
</Note>

After a Group is created you can add CIDs to it using the [addCids](/ipfs-sdk/groups/add-cids) method. Just pass in the `groupId` and an array of `cids`.

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const group = await pinata.groups.addCids({
	groupId: "3778c10d-452e-4def-8299-ee6bc548bdb0",
	cids: ["QmVLwvmGehsrNEvhcCnnsw5RQNseohgEkFNN1848zNzdng"],
});
```

If successful, the endpoint will return an `OK` response.

### Removing CIDs from a Group // TO DO

To remove CIDs from a Group, you would follow the same pattern as `addCids` except using the [removeCids](/ipfs-sdk/groups/remove-files) method instead.

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const group = await pinata.groups.removeCids({
	groupId: "3778c10d-452e-4def-8299-ee6bc548bdb0",
	cids: ["QmVLwvmGehsrNEvhcCnnsw5RQNseohgEkFNN1848zNzdng"],
});
```

If successful, the endpoint will return an `OK` response.

### Add Files to Groups

<Note>
  At this time, CIDs can only belong to one group at a time. If a CID is added
  to a Group while already being part of another, it will move the CID to the
  latest requested Group.
</Note>

There are a few ways you can add files to a Group after you have created one.

#### Upload Directly

After creating a group, you can click on it, then click the "Add" button in the top right to add files directly to the group.

### Remove Files from Group

While inside the Group view, you can remove files from a group by either clicking on the file detail for a single file or by using the multi-select tool.

### Deleting Groups

<Note>
  Deleting a Group that has CIDs inside of it will not unpin/delete the CIDs.
  Please follow the [unpin guide](pinning/deleting-files) to actually delete a
  file from your account
</Note>

To delete a Group, navigate to the Groups page, click on the details of the Group, and select the "Delete Group" from the dropdown.
