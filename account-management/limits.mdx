The Pinata platform currently has the following rate limits in place:

## File Restrictions

HTML uploads are currently only available on paid plans with granted access. If you are on a paid plan and wish to upload HTML please send a request through our support chat or send an email to [team@pinata.cloud](mailto:team@pinata.cloud)

## API Rate Limits

The Pinata API currently has a rate limit of 180 requests per minute to our API.

### Exceptions

The following API calls have increased rate limits:

- Endpoints under the `/data/` route have a rate limit of 30 requests per minute
- The [Pinning Services API endpoint for listing content](https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec/#tag/pins/paths/~1pins/get) has a rate limit of 30 requests per minute

### Recommendations

For users with traffic that can be burst-heavy, we recommend using a task scheduler or queue-based upload approach that limits requests to the allowed amount.

For NodeJS users specifically, we recommend the [bottleneck library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bottleneck) to help with this.

## Gateway Rate Limits

At this time there are currently no rate limits for users retrieving content from a dedicated gateway.

## Upload Size Limits

<Warning>While the upload limit is 25GB we would recommend only uploading up to 15GB per file/folder for reliability reasons. We can try to assist uploads 15GB-25GB but we cannot guarantee success at this time.</Warning>

There is no aggregate limit for uploads, but each individual upload (whether it is a file or a folder) is limited to **25 GB**.

There is also a file limit size of **10MB** for the pinJSONToIPFS API endpoint.
